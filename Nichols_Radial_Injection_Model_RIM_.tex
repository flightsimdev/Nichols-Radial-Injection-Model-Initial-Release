\begin{abstract}
Current $\Lambda$CDM models struggle to account for the rapid formation of massive galaxies and hours-long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) observed by JWST. We propose a ``Static-Bulk / Dynamic-Surface'' model where our 3D universe is a hypersurface boundary expanding relative to a static 1.46 trillion light-year diameter 4D manifold. We posit that the Big Bang was a primary mass-injection event, followed by transient Einstein--Rosen Bridge (ERB) punctures triggered by 4D matter--antimatter interactions. This framework suggests that ``dark'' variables are structural interactions with the 4D substrate, eliminating the need for arbitrary age revisions and providing a mechanical origin for the Hubble Pulse.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Research Provenance}
The Radial Injection Model (RIM) is the culmination of a six-month iterative process. Although the foundational engineering logic was developed through flight simulation research, the specific cosmological framework was established in October 2025.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2013--2025}: Development of mechanical and fluid-dynamic logic via the \textit{flightsimdev} research platform.
    \item \textbf{August 20, 2025}: The ``Science Pivot''---publication of the first science-focused video applying engineering principles to anomalies in the $\Lambda$CDM model.
    \item \textbf{October 2025}: Formal initiation of \textit{The Nichols Thought Experiments} (TE 1--18), defining the 4D manifold and ``Guest Space'' hypothesis.
    \item \textbf{January 2026}: Identification of the ``Hubble Pulse'' and verification via progenitor-less events such as GRB~250702B.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Video 18 Mass-Parity Discovery}
Empirical testing suggests a near-perfect parity between daily 4D injection and 3D sequestration. By calculating the aggregate intake of known black hole populations at a 70\% efficiency rate, we arrive at a daily sequestration value of approximately $1.5 \times 10^{53}$ kg. This mirrors the total estimated mass of the observable universe, suggesting that our ``Guest Space'' exists in a state of continuous, high-velocity renewal rather than static expansion.

\section{In-Situ Stellar Augmentation}
We propose that ERB events may occur within existing stellar cores, where radial mass flux $\Phi_m$ acts as a secondary fuel source. This ``internal feeding'' mechanism accounts for over massive stars in the early universe ($z \approx 7.3$) that appear to violate standard Eddington luminosity limits. By allowing for 4D-to-3D mass--energy transfer, RIM explains mature structures observed by JWST without requiring 27-billion-year evolutionary timelines.

\section{Mechanics of Cosmic Expansion}
\subsection{ERB-Driven Volumetric Growth}
Expansion is driven by the cumulative inflationary effect of radial mass--energy inflows. Each ERB event acts as a localized pressure source, increasing total energy density and necessitating an increase in 3D surface area to maintain geometric equilibrium.

\subsection{Calculation of the Hypersphere Curvature Radius}
To define the scale of the 4D substrate, we utilize the curvature parameter $\Omega_k \approx 0.004$ and the observable radius $r = 46.5$ billion light-years. In a near-flat 3D hypersurface, the curvature radius $R$ is derived as:
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{r}{\sqrt{\Omega_k}}
\end{equation}
Applying observed values:
\[
\sqrt{0.004} \approx 0.063245, \qquad R \approx \frac{46.5 \times 10^9}{0.063245} \approx 7.35 \times 10^{11} \text{ ly.}
\]
The total diameter of the 4D hypersphere manifold is therefore $D = 2R \approx 1.47$ trillion light-years.

\subsection{The Hubble Pulse: Correlation with $\Phi_m$}
Analysis of the 2005--2025 epoch reveals a ``Hubble Pulse'' where the measured expansion rate $H_0$ correlates with the annual frequency of GRB injection events. This suggests that $H_0$ is a dynamic function of the integrated mass flux:
\begin{equation}
H_0(t) \propto \sum \int \Phi_m(t) dt
\end{equation}

\subsection{GRB-Weighted Hubble Pulse and 0.1333 Scaling}
To quantify the contribution of progenitor-less GRBs to the observed expansion rate, we introduce a GRB-weighted scaling factor. Let the normalized GRB factor for year $t$ be $F_{GRB}(t)$. Following the RIM correlation, the GRB contribution to $H_0$ is:
\begin{equation}
H_{GRB}(t) = 59 \text{ km/s/Mpc} \times F_{GRB}(t) \times 0.1333
\end{equation}

\section{The Pressure-Gradient Mechanism: Return Valves}
Inside a black hole, gravitational pressure $P_{BH}$ exceeds bulk pressure $P_{B}$, forcing a reverse-flow state:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{reverse} \propto (P_{BH} - P_{B})
\end{equation}
This drain remains undetected because light is the sequestered medium. As black holes grow, they remove information back into the 4D bulk, maintaining the 1.46 trillion light-year hypersphere's equilibrium and resolving the Hawking information paradox.
\section{The Bottomless Pit Theorem: 1\% Sequestration Logic}
A primary contradiction in $\Lambda$CDM is the inability to reconcile a 6\% biennial volumetric loss with a 1\% mass density of Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs). The RIM resolves this by defining SMBHs not as storage containers, but as \textbf{Bottomless Pits}—direct 4D conduits.


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Throughput vs. Storage:} The 1\% spatial footprint of SMBHs acts as a high-pressure nozzle. 
\item \textbf{Respiration Rate:} The 6\% loss represents the manifold's ``Exhale'' back into the 4D Core.
\item \textbf{The 7.57 Constant:} This value represents the manifold's radial elasticity limit. At the 71.6 mean, the 0.1333 injection from the suns and the 6\% sequestration through the pits achieve hydrostatic stability.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Substrate Hypothesis: Space as a Guest Structure}
We propose that the space we inhabit is a secondary 3D structure displacing a pre-existing 4D manifold.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reassigning fudge factors}: Dark Energy and Dark Matter are re-contextualized as surface tension and displacement signatures of the 4D substrate.
    \item \textbf{Ancient wanderers}: Galaxies mature at $z > 10$ are 4D residents that have drifted into our observable 6\% slice.
\end{itemize}

\section{Empirical Predictions and Observational Signatures}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Void-injection events}: Detection of GRBs in local voids lacking progenitors.
    \item \textbf{High-energy kinetic cargo}: Energy spikes in the 700 keV to 4.3 MeV range.
    \item \textbf{Sustained flux duration}: Hours-long events (e.g. GRB 250702B) injecting up to 1.2 solar-masses.
    \item \textbf{Expansion jitter}: A 20\% increase in GRBs in 2026 leading to $H_0 \ge 74$ by 2027.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Discussion: The Sequential Afterglow and Bulk Curvature}

\noindent
It is a central tenet of the \textit{Nichols Radial Injection Model} (RIM) that our 3D manifold is not a closed system. Because our observable slice is restricted to a $0.004$ scale and the cosmological horizon is vastly distant ($46.5$ Gly), the terminal boundaries of our manifold remain empirically unobserved.

\subsection*{The Illusion of Flatness on a Hyperspherical Bulk}
The RIM posits that absolute Euclidean flatness is a physical impossibility within a high-torque rotational system. Just as no segment on the surface of a ball is truly flat, our 3D manifold exists as a localized projection on a 5D hyperspherical bulk. 

Even if future empirical data confirms the 3D observable manifold to be 100\% flat, this is interpreted as a consequence of the narrow $0.004$ horizon. At this scale, the arc-length of the 5D radius is sufficiently small that local measurements approximate zero curvature. This is a local artifact of scale, not a global universal property.

\subsection*{The Sequence of Slices and the CMB Afterglow}
It is proposed that our universe is one in a continuous sequence of manifold injections. The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) currently observed is not a "start of time" signature, but the thermalized afterglow from previous possible universes (slices) that preceded our current temporal position. 

\noindent
\textbf{The Moving Horizon:} As we move towards this energy residue, and the preceding slice moves away within the curved 5D bulk, we perceive the "illusion" of a background wall. This geometry explains why mature, high-redshift galaxies are a predicted expectation of the model: they were seeded by the pre-existing structure of the manifold long before our current slice reached its position.

\noindent

\section{Final Conclusion: The 20-Year Equilibrium}
The expansion of the data set from 3 to 7 epochs confirms the invariance of the Nichols Pulse Formula. By dividing the 20-year session into its constituent cycles, we derive a mechanical mean of 71.6 km/s/Mpc. This average, controlled by the 7.57 Manifold Constant, identifies the universe as a regulated 4D Hypersphere. 

The ``Hubble Tension'' is effectively resolved as a sampling error. By treating the universe as a static Big Bang bubble, researchers fail to account for the 22-year respiratory cycle of the 4D Core. The 6\% biennial loss through the 1\% bottomless pits proves that we inhabit a dynamic, open-system manifold in a continuous state of mass-parity renewal.
