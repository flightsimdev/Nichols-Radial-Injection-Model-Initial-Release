This repository contains the Radial Injection Model (RIM), a mechanical framework identifying the universe as a regulated 4D Hypersphere synchronized with the 22-year Solar Hale Cycle.
20-Year Manifold Audit (New)

The February 2026 update moves beyond initial datasets to a comprehensive 20-year aggregate audit. By analyzing seven data epochs, the model establishes a Mechanical Mean for the Hubble constant, resolving the "Hubble Tension" as a periodic respiratory cycle.
Key Findings:

    The 71.6 Mean: The 20-year aggregate identifies an equilibrium set-point of 71.6 km/s/Mpc.

    Formula Validation: The RIM formula (Hcalc​=59×FGRB​×0.1333) predicts a raw injection of 72.6.

    The 1.0 Sequestration Delta: The ≈1.0 difference between calculated and measured means confirms the Sequestration Velocity—the rate at which mass-energy returns to the 4D core through "Bottomless Pit" drains.

    The 7.57 Constant: Identifies the manifold's radial elasticity limit.

    6% Biennial Loss: Confirms a 6% volumetric "Exhale" every two years into 1% mass-density sequestration valves (SMBHs).

Repository Contents

    Full LaTeX Source & PDF: The finalized Nichols RIM paper featuring the 7-epoch audit.

    20-Year Dataset: Comprehensive GRB frequency and H0​ measurements (2004–2026).

    Hypersphere Visualizations: Diagrams of the 4D core, radial injection, and bottomless pit sequestration.

Mechanical Foundations

The RIM replaces abstract ΛCDM "fudge factors" with structural interactions. It posits that the "Point" of origin is not a historical event, but a current spatial interface—a 4D Core located "in the middle" of every stellar body.
