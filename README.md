# Nichols Radial Injection Model (RIM)

**Author:** Lawrence William Nichols  
**Date:** January 21, 2026

This repository contains the Radial Injection Model (RIM), a data-driven
framework connecting black hole feeding rates, Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) events,
and measured variations in the Hubble constant (H₀). It includes:

- Full LaTeX source and PDF of the Nichols Radial Injection Model paper.
- GRB frequency and H₀ measurement datasets from 2011–2026.
- Python/Jupyter scripts to reproduce H₀ calculations and visualizations.
- Figures illustrating the Hubble Pulse and radial injection mechanisms.

The model emphasizes reproducibility and provides testable predictions for
future progenitor-less GRBs and H₀ fluctuations.
