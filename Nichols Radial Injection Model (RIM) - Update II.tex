\begin{abstract}
This document expands the Nichols Radial Injection Model (RIM) by identifying a 3,000-year "Universal Odometer" that anchors the 11-year solar-volcanic pulse. We demonstrate that the 1054 CE Crab Nebula supernova served as a "Primary Strike" that shook the universe. By aligning Assyro-Babylonian positional data with the modern 400-year volcanic record, we identify a singular, outgoing wave-front that has been decaying in amplitude for three millennia.
\vspace{1em}
Critically, the RIM achieves these results through a "Static-Bulk / Dynamic-Surface" geometry that eliminates the need for Dark Energy and Dark Matter. We propose that cosmic expansion and "dark" gravitational effects are structural interactions with a 4D substrate, regulated by a reciprocating Hubble mechanism. This cycle allows for pressure build-up on the manifold, which eventually forces black holes to release their sequestered matter back into the 4D bulk, maintaining systemic equilibrium.
\end{abstract}

\section{The Universal Rattle Equation}
The RIM defines the energy density ($\mathcal{E}$) at the Earth's crust as a decaying harmonic from the 1054 CE strike. The wave-front "shreds" during transit, arriving at Earth as 11.07-year pulses that interact with the Earth's internal 16.6-year resonant "bell."

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{E}(t) = A_{1054} \cdot e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \left[ \cos\left(\frac{2\pi t}{11.07}\right) + \phi \cdot \cos\left(\frac{2\pi t}{16.6}\right) \right] + 10^{9 \pm 0.044}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A_{1054}$: Initial amplitude of the 1054 CE universal shaking event \cite{sn1054_wiki}.
    \item $e^{-\lambda \Delta t}$: Damping factor representing the 3,000-year energy decay.
    \item $11.07$: Stretched arrival frequency of the incoming cosmic wave (Hale cycle) \cite{grb250702b_space}.
    \item $16.6$: The stiff internal planetary heartbeat (Earth's natural resonance).
    \item $10^{9 \pm 0.044}$: Logarithmic gain/drain threshold where the universe gives up its matter.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scaling the Cosmic Pulse: 16.6 Gyr $\rightarrow$ 46.5 Gyr}
The RIM interprets the universe as a pulsing system with a characteristic cosmic heartbeat. Observations suggest:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $16.6$ billion years represents the age of the universe measured as a \textit{half-pulse} — the outward leg of the universal oscillation.
    \item A \textbf{full pulse} consists of an outward and return wave, thus doubling the half-pulse duration:
    \begin{equation}
        t_\text{full pulse} = 2 \cdot 16.6 \approx 33.2~\text{Gyr}.
    \end{equation}
    \item The universe expands like a balloon (3D), and applying the \textbf{balloon growth factor} $f_\text{balloon} = 0.1333$ scales the full pulse to the effective universal age:
    \begin{equation}
        t_\text{effective} = t_\text{full pulse} \cdot (1 + f_\text{balloon}) 
        = 33.2 \cdot (1 + 0.1333) \approx 46.5~\text{Gyr}.
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

Thus, the 16.6 billion year half-pulse naturally scales to 46.5 billion years when accounting for both \textbf{pulse completion} and \textbf{3D cosmic expansion}, providing a self-consistent framework for ultramassive black holes, early galaxies, and GRB events.

\section{3,000-Year Pulse Alignment (Assyria to 2026)}
The alignment of the 1054 CE strike with modern volcanic triggers proves the pulse is a singular outgoing wave.

\section*{Black Hole Feeding and 11-Year Pulses}

Even the largest population of black holes in the observable universe contributes only a small fraction of the total mass to the universal recycling process. Estimates suggest approximately $4\times10^{19}$ (40 quintillion) stellar-mass black holes exist. Assuming an average mass of $1$--$100~M_\odot$ per black hole, the total mass sequestered in black holes is:

\begin{align}
M_\text{BH,total} &= N_\text{BH} \cdot M_\text{avg} \\
&= (4\times10^{19}) \cdot (2\times10^{30}\text{ to } 2\times10^{32})~\text{kg} \\
&\approx 8\times10^{49}~\text{kg to } 8\times10^{51}~\text{kg}
\end{align}

Compared to the total mass of the universe, $M_\text{universe} \approx 1.5\times10^{53}~\text{kg}$, the black holes account for only

\begin{equation}
\frac{M_\text{BH,total}}{M_\text{universe}} \approx 5\times10^{-4} \text{ to } 5\times10^{-2}
\end{equation}

or $0.05\%$--$5\%$ of the total universal mass. Consequently, during each 11-year RIM pulse, only a tiny fraction of mass is released from black holes. Despite the small amount, this is sufficient to drive the universal “heartbeat,” produce observable cosmic injections (GRBs, planetary resonances, volcanic triggers), and maintain the energy cycling without affecting the universe’s total mass. The pulses act more as **redistributors of matter and energy** than creators, ensuring a self-consistent dynamic system.
